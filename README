# OpenLB - Open Source Lattice Boltzmann Code

The OpenLB project is a C++ package for the implementation of lattice Boltzmann
methods addressing a vast range of transport problems.

## Dependencies

The only mandatory external dependency of OpenLB is GNU Make and a C++ compiler
with C++14 support. This includes all reasonably recent versions of GCC, Clang
and ICC.

ParaView and gnuplot are optional dependencies for visualizing simulation results.

## Build

1. Adjust the `config.mk` file to fit your local compiler environment.
   Preset values are for GCC compilation without parallelization support.
2. Build the library core using `make`

### Examples

All examples may be compiled in one go using `make samples`.

To compile an individual example such as a basic flow around a cylinder:

1. Switch to `examples/laminar/cylinder2d`
2. Execute `make`
3. Run the program via `./cylinder2d`
4. Follow the program output while it is running
5. VTK and gnuplot results can be found in the `tmp/` folder

## Community

The OpenLB forum [3] is an open discussion board for all aspects of LBM and OpenLB.
Feel free to post any problems, questions, suggestions or contributions.

You can also reach us via mail at info@openlb.net

There is a yearly one-week Spring School [4] where you can learn about LBM and
OpenLB directly from the developer team and invited guest lecturers.

A list of all present and past contributors is available at [5].
